## Usage Instructions
The FINAL.avl file is the most up-to-date AVL file of the aircraft configuration. Any other .avl files should be considered prototype and personal files.

Any relevant aerodynamic data should be saved and indicated as linked to a version of the FINAL.evl to which it correlates.

## Git Usage Instructions

To use this respository:

* Users who are familiar with Git: the clone target is `git@github.com:amiramalik33/16.821.git` if you're using SSH or `https://github.com/amiramalik33/16.821.git` if you're using HTTPS.
* Users who are new to Git: I think the easiest interface to Git for most new users is GitHub Desktop. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77W2JSL7-r8) is a good introduction video (15 mins). Once you've watched that, congratulations! You now fall into the "familiar with Git" category above and can use the instructions in the previous bullet. Aren't recursive README instructions great?
* Users who are new to Git and don't want to use Git: Just download a local copy of the current repository from [here](https://github.com/amiramalik33/16.821/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Beware that this copy will not stay up-to-date with future improvements, so this may quickly become outdated! (Honestly, this is not recommended)
